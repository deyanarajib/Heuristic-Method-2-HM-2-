# Heuristic-Method-2--HM-2-
 A method for solving Transportation Problem

Heuristic Method 2 Algorithm
Step 1: Determine the penalty i.e. the difference between the lowest and highest cost element of thet row/column.
Step 2: Identify the row/column having highest penalty and choose the variable having lowest cost in this selected row/column.
Step 3: Allocate as much as possible to this variable.
Step 4: Cross out the row or column which ever is statisfied and adjust the variable and required quantities.
Step 5: Compute the penalties and repeat procedure till all rows and columns are satisfied.
